        <Heading as="h3" size="md">Getting to Niagara</Heading>
        <Text>If traveling by air, there are two main options for getting to Niagara from Toronto: by car or by GO train on the Lakeshore West Line. However, the GO service is a commuter line and thus does not run all day. From Pearson (Toronto International) Airport, the UP Express train can take you to Union Station to access the GO train. From Billy Bishop (Toronto City) Airport, a quick streetcar ride can get you to Union. The nearest GO station to the wedding venue is St. Catharines. St. Catharines is about 15 minutes by car from the wedding venue.</Text>
        <Text>It is much simpler to drive to the Niagara region via the QEW, so if possible, renting a car is the most convenient option. If renting a car, flying into Pearson is much more convenient than flyng into Billy Bishop. Reach out to Aky or Andrew if you need help planning your trip, can offer ride sharing, or would like to find a ride.</Text>

        <Text>The ceremony at Cave Spring Vineyard is about a 10 minute drive from the reception at Inn on the Twenty. Alternative forms of transportation are not as widely available, so carpooling is encouraged.</Text>
